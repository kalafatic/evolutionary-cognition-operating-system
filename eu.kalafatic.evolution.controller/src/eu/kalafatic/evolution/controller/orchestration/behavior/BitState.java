/**
 * Utility for encoding and decoding the orchestration state into a 64-bit bitfield.
 *
 * Layout:
 * bits 0–7     → MODE (LOCAL / REMOTE / HYBRID / PROXY / MEDIATED)
 * bits 8–15    → SUPERVISION (AUTO / MANUAL / HYBRID)
 * bits 16–23   → INTERACTION MODE (CONTINUOUS / STEP / GUIDED)
 * bits 24–31   → REASONING STYLE (ATOMIC / DARWIN / CONSERVATIVE / EXPLORATORY / ANALYTICAL)
 * bits 32–39   → WORKFLOW (TASK / SELF_DEV / HYBRID / EXPORT)
 * bits 40–47   → OPTIONS (Bit 0: AUTO_APPROVE)
 * bits 48–63   → EXTENSIONS / FUTURE FEATURES
