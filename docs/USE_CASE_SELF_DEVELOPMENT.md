# Use Case: Self-Development

## Scenario
The AI kernel identifies a bottleneck in its own `SignalBus` and proposes an optimization.

## 1. Intent Analysis
- **System Intent**: "Optimize SignalBus performance by introducing a concurrent lock-free queue."
- **IntentExpansionEngine**: Detects `OPTIMIZATION` and `SELF-DEVELOPMENT`.
- **EPS Score**: High (~0.90) due to self-modifying risk.

## 2. Orchestration Routing
- Full `DarwinFlow` execution on the `eu.kalafatic.evolution.controller` package.

## 3. Self-Development Pipeline
1. **HYPOTHESIS**: `DarwinEngine` creates a hypothesis that a lock-free queue will reduce latency by 15%.
2. **BRANCHING**: `v1` is created with `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue`.
3. **SELF-EVALUATION**: The platform runs its own test suite and a set of performance micro-benchmarks.
4. **TRAJECTORY REINFORCEMENT**: `v1` passes all tests and shows a 20% improvement. The strategy "lock-free-queue" is reinforced in `TrajectoryMemory`.
5. **COMMIT**: The `IterationManager` commits the changes to its own source code.

## Key Takeaway
Self-development demonstrates the platform's ability to apply its evolutionary mechanics to its own architecture, enabling autonomous improvement within safe, kernel-controlled boundaries.
